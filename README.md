# FinBot
Cornell FinTech Club Spring '25 Project

## About

We built a chatbot that answers questions about institutional investor behavior by analyzing SEC Form 13F filings. These filings, submitted quarterly by investment managers with over $100 million in assets, disclose their holdings in U.S. exchange-traded securities, including position sizes, market values, and asset types.

Our system uses a PostgreSQL database of 13F filings, a LangChain SQL Agent to interpret natural language queries, and a Streamlit frontend to deliver insights. Users can ask questions in plain English and receive data-driven answers about institutional trading trends.

Example questions it can answer:

* "Which top 5 firms increased their Tesla holdings the most over the last two quarters?"
* "Has BlackRock shifted from financials to healthcare in the past year?"
* "What new positions did Berkshire Hathaway add this quarter?"

This information can help investors understand large firms' strategies. For example, if a major firm suddenly puts a lot more money into healthcare, it could indicate that they expect that sector to grow, maybe by anticipating policy changes in that area. This can inform your own portfolio strategy. It can also give you insights into the risk exposure of the firm itself.

## FinBot Local Development Setup

This guide walks you through:

1. Cloning the repo  
2. Creating a Python virtual environment  
3. Installing dependencies  
4. Setting up PostgreSQL locally  
5. Populating the database  
6. Running tests  

---

## 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nslingo/FinBot.git
cd FinBot
```

---

## 2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv

# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Windows PowerShell:
.\\venv\\Scripts\\activate
```

---

## 3. Install Python dependencies

Install `requirements.txt` with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 4. Set up PostgreSQL locally

### A. Starting PostgreSQL server manually

- **macOS (Homebrew)**:
  ```bash
  brew services start postgresql
  ```

- **Linux (systemd)**:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start postgresql
  ```

- **Windows (pgAdmin4 bundled service)**:
  1. Open **pgAdmin 4**.
  2. In the Browser panel, right-click **Servers** → **Create** → **Server...** and configure your local server connection if not present.

### B. Creating the database via pgAdmin 4

1. In pgAdmin's Browser, expand your server, right-click **Databases** → **Create** → **Database...**
2. In the **General** tab:
   - **Database**: `finbot`
   - **Owner**: your user (e.g. `postgres`)
3. In the **Definition** tab:
   - **Template**: `template0`
4. Click **Save**.

### C. Applying the schema

1. Right-click the new `finbot` database → **Query Tool**.
2. Open or paste the contents of `init_db.sql` into the editor.
3. Click **Execute/Refresh** (▶️) to run the script and create tables.

Verify tables via the Query Tool:

```sql
\dt
-- should list: investmentmanagers, filings, securities, holdings
```

---

## 5. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file:

```ini
DB_NAME=finbot
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
```

---

## 6. Populate the database

```bash
# Full run (7.6k CIKs) - may take 1-2 hours
python populate_db.py

# Quick run (first 10 CIKs)
python populate_db.py --limit 10
```

---

## 7. Running tests

```bash
python Tests/test_insert.py
python Tests/test_get_filings.py
```

---

## 8. Inspect data

In pgAdmin4, view tables by clicking through Schemas → Tables → Right-click desired table → View/Edit Data → All Rows

Or through query tool:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM InvestmentManagers;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Filings;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Securities;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Holdings;
```
